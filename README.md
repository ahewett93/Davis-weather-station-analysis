  <h1>Atmoshperic Sciences 451 - Weather Station Data Analysis Project </h1>
  <h3>By Alex Hewett, Undergraduate, Atmospheric Sciences Department, University of Washington</h3>
  <h2>What's in it?</h2>
    <p>Contains a data files directory, Jupyter notebook for analysis, and a technical paper reporting the results.</p>
  <h2>What was it?</h2>
  <p>This project consisted of groups setting up a Davis weather station locally, recording and sharing observations over a period of weeks, and then analyzing the data writing a technical paper comparing observations amongst stations and investigating why stations might differ from each other. The project also focused on a particular weather event that occured during the observation period. This paper focused on a arctic air outbreak that occured in Seattle, WA on February of 2022.</p>
  <p>I invite you to read my paper "Sleetless in Seattle..." listed in this repository. It is a ~5 min read and it gives some fun insights into how weather observations can vary dramatically across a small geographic area.</p>
