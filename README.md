  <p>This project consisted of groups setting up a Davis weather station locally, recording and sharing observations over a period of weeks, and then analyzing the data writing a technical paper comparing observations amongst stations and investigating why stations might differ from each other. The project also focused on a particular weather event that occured during the observation period. This paper focused on a arctic air outbreak that occured in Seattle, WA on February of 2022.</p>
